# RNASeq-ML
Machine learning workflows for classifying RNA-seq gene expression data.

This repo contains the full pipeline used to:
- preprocess RNA-seq expression matrices
- perform dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoder)
- train neural network and classical machine-learning classifiers
- evaluate accuracy and visualize results

All code is organized into Jupyter notebooks for easy reproducibility.

## 📝 Notes
- Dataset is not included due to size limits; notebooks contain instructions for loading your own data.
- This project comes from academic coursework but represents real ML workflow design and evaluation.
